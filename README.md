# CanalPilot

Key acceptance checks (verify via the UI search boxes):

- Norton Junction → Foxton Junction: route polyline stays on-canal even when varying speed/lookahead.
- North Kilworth Marina → Foxton Junction: route polyline stays on-canal and does not flip to a straight line unless Overpass/CRT are unavailable.
